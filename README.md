# Stock Price Predictor with Sentiment Analysis

A comprehensive stock price prediction application that combines machine learning models with news sentiment analysis to predict S&P 500 stock prices.

## Features

- **Multiple ML Models**: LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble predictions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time news sentiment analysis affecting stock prices
- **Technical Indicators**: 20+ technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful Streamlit interface with real-time visualizations
- **S&P 500 Coverage**: Pre-configured with top 50 S&P 500 stocks

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended for training)
- Internet connection for data fetching

## Installation

1. **Clone or create the project directory**:
```bash
mkdir stock-predictor
cd stock-predictor
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API Setup

### NewsAPI (Required for sentiment analysis)

1. Visit [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/)
2. Click "Get API Key"
3. Register with your email (free tier = 100 requests/day)
4. Copy your API key

### Setting up API keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=your_alphavantage_key_here  # Optional
```

Or modify `config.py` directly:
```python
NEWS_API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key_here'
```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit app**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

## How to Use

### Step 1: Select a Stock
- Use the sidebar to select a stock symbol (e.g., UNH, AAPL, MSFT)
- Adjust the historical data range and prediction horizon

### Step 2: Fetch Data
- Click "üîÑ Fetch Data" to download stock data and analyze news sentiment
- The app will display current price, volume, sentiment scores, and technical indicators

### Step 3: Train Models
- Click "üéØ Train Model" to train all ML models on the historical data
- Training takes 1-3 minutes depending on your hardware
- Model performance metrics will be displayed

### Step 4: Make Predictions
- Select your preferred model (Ensemble recommended)
- Click "üîÆ Make Prediction" to generate future price predictions
- View predictions with confidence intervals

## Understanding the Output

### Metrics Displayed:
- **Current Price**: Latest closing price
- **Volume**: Trading volume with day-over-day change
- **Sentiment Score**: Aggregated news sentiment (-1 to +1)
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, etc.

### Prediction Results:
- **Price Chart**: Historical prices with future predictions
- **Confidence Interval**: Uncertainty range for predictions
- **Recommendation**: Buy/Hold/Sell signal based on predicted trend
- **Risk Metrics**: Volatility and drawdown calculations

## Model Details

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Deep learning model for time series
- 3-layer architecture with dropout
- Best for capturing long-term dependencies

### Random Forest
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Good for feature importance analysis
- Robust to outliers

### XGBoost
- Gradient boosting algorithm
- Fast and accurate
- Handles non-linear relationships well

### Ensemble Model
- Weighted combination of all models
- Generally provides best performance
- Reduces individual model bias

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No module named 'package_name'"**
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **NewsAPI Error**
   - Check your API key is valid
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded the free tier limit (100 requests/day)

3. **Memory Error during training**
   - Reduce the historical data range
   - Close other applications
   - Use a smaller batch size

4. **No data for symbol**
   - Ensure the symbol is correct and traded on major exchanges
   - Check your internet connection

## Performance Tips

1. **For faster training**:
   - Use shorter historical periods (90-180 days)
   - Select fewer technical indicators
   - Use Random Forest or XGBoost instead of LSTM

2. **For better accuracy**:
   - Use more historical data (1-2 years)
   - Enable all technical indicators
   - Use the Ensemble model
   - Ensure good quality news data

## Data Sources

- **Stock Data**: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)
- **News Data**: NewsAPI and Yahoo Finance
- **No database required**: Uses local caching
